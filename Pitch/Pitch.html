            <h1>Intro</h1>
    
            <p>This might come off as cocky; probably is, but you should HIRE MEü´µüèΩ<br><br>
            I worked on this portfolio, inspired by nothing but the need to show off my creative side. I started by sourcing for and utilizing the background video which speaks to and speaks of my style as one who appreciates 'dark-textured' art.
            <br>My name is Eguagie Dennis Oghosa. Friends call me 'OG', and I'll like you to consider me for the position of junior frontend developer.</p> <br>
    
            <h1>Background</h1>
    
            <p>I started writing codes in 2023, all thanks to udemy, and later on, Vephla institute. </p> 
            <p>Before that however, I had done alot of important work in the media industry, in both radio and television. Infact, I'll not be wrong to posit that my creative juices started flowing because of my time in that space.
              <br>During my time on the radio, we used a web product called anydesk to operate systems in other states! I was beyond facinated by the whole thing! This singular product necessitated my love for computers and how to build cool stuff using them.</p>    
           <p>Whew! I know you didn't ask for the aforementioned shalaye (extensive and indepth explanation), but I had to give some sort of glimpse into my life so far.
            You can already tell I am heavily fixated on the creative aspect of web products, largely due to my history in the media; audio and visual.
            What you will also discover is, with the projects in my portfolio, I pretty much learnt alot building them. And I will keep on learning.
           </p><br>
    
           <h1>Stacks</h1>
    
           <p>Frontend: Vanilla Javascript. <br>
    
            HTML & Css: Quite decent. <br>
    
            In view: React.
           </p> <br>
    
           <h1>Best Project(s)</h1>
    
           <p>Handigo: Thoroughly imperfect, but such a learning curve and collaborative effort.</p>
    
           <p>Basically, our app was meant to be a solution that seeks to make artisans available at your finger tips. Especially for the vulnerable (women who live alone), and 'gated-communities' concerned about safety. It included a system with which you could rate the performance of these artisans by leaving star reviews as well as detailing why you are giving them said star rating.
            
            I worked with/am still working with a couple of my friends who range from project managers, product designers and another engineer.</p> <br>
